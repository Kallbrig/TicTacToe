# TicTacToe
Basic python Tic-Tac-Toe game using recursion

# What I learned
* Tic tac toe has a lot of win conditions.
* I learned about recursion and implemented it into a few methods.
* I challenged myself to do this project without using global variables. This helped me when I implemented the recursion.
